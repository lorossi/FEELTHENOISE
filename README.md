# Feel the noise

Yet another video made in the single most counter-intuitive, over-engineered way.
I can't even place a gif in here because it weights about 50MB. *Yeah, 50.* I don't know why the compression algorithm has failed me.

Lately, I have been wanting to to experiment a little bit with shapes, letters, and (oddly enough) trigonometric functions.
The latter have this beautiful property of looping around flawless, orderly, without ever failing.

I have to say that I have been always fascinated by them *(how could you guess that I have always been a strange child?)* because everything in math is built on top of those simple functions.
*Is it because we built maths on top of them or is the other way around?*

I'm having quite a lot of fun with this kind of *"artsy"* sketches. I'm going to fiddle a lot more with those.

Check the full video out on my [Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTNnK2Ki2BX) where you can see a lot of my other stuff as well.
If you're feeling brave you can find the rendered video in the `output` folder.
