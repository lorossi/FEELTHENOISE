Yet another video made in the single most counter-intuitive, over-engineered way.⠀
⠀
Lately, I have been wanting to to experiment a little bit with shapes, letters, and (oddly enough) trigonometric functions. The latter have this beautiful property of looping around flawless, orderly, without ever failing.⠀
I have to say that I have been always fascinated by them *(how could you guess that I have always been a strange child?)* because everything in math is built on top of those simple functions. *Is it because we built maths on top of them or is the other way around?*⠀
I'm having quite a lot of fun with this kind of *"artsy"* videos. I'm going to play a lot more with those.⠀
